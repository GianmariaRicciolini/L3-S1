        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          For the focaccia
        </ul>
        <li>4 capus (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (350g) lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin oil, plus more for the pan</li>
        <ul>
          For the topping:
        </ul>
        <li>3 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil, for brushing on top</li>
        <li>
          10 ounces brie, cut into cubes (scrape rind off with a paring knife if desired, though it's not necessary)
        </li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries</li>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol></ol>
        <li>Make the focaccia dough</li>
        <p>
          In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough
          Ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I sometimes
          knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the last of the flour...
